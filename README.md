# OpenMediaSearch
This is meant to be a terminal command to search and open Media quicker.
The program will first search through local files using [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to see if the searched media is already downloaded.
If not, the program will open a media search engine of the searched term in the default web browser. The default media search engine is an instance of movie-web.
